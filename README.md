# DeliriumHarmonization

BASIL/NIDUS Harmonization Paper

The goal of this analysis is to describe the level of agreement and a harmonized scale of severity applicable to several commonly used delirium instruments: the CAM-S, DRS-R98, MDAS. We do this in the context of a single clinical research study, where a team of trained lay interviewers administered each instrument along with supporting stimulus assessments in the same group of patients.
